A New Jersey man died at a hotel in the Dominican Republic last week, his family says, making him at least the ninth US tourist to die at a Dominican Republic resort, or after becoming ill at one, over the past 13 months.
Joseph Allen, 55, of Avenel, New Jersey, was found dead June 13 in his room at the Hotel Terra Linda in the coastal Dominican Republic city of Sosua, his sister Jaimie Reed told CNN.
Joseph Allen died June 13 after falling ill in the Dominican Republic, his family says.
Preliminary autopsy results suggest that he suffered from cardiac arrest. There were no signs of violence, according to the report, which Dominican authorities provided to CNN.
Allen's family doesn't know what caused his death. He was traveling with friends, and had stayed at the same resort many other times before, Reed said.
Allen's friends have told the family that he complained about not feeling well last Wednesday. Hotel staff found him dead in his room early Thursday after friends expressed concern that he hadn't met up with them that morning, Reed said.
The US State Department confirmed the death.
