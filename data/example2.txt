The Duchess of Cambridge led the glamour as the Royal Family turned out in force for the first day of Royal Ascot.
Elegant in a blue lace creation by Elie Saab, Kate, 37, beamed as she caught up with Zara Tindall, 38, and Princess Eugenie, 29, at the Berkshire racecourse today.
Mike Tindall, 40, appeared in particularly high spirits and was seen joking with Prince William, 36, Sophie Wessex, 54, and even the Queen, 93, during the lively family family gathering.
Elsewhere Prince Charles, 70, was spotted chuckling as he and the Duchess of Cornwall, 71, spoke to a mounted jockey, while Prince Andrew and Prince Edward kept a rather more low profile.
Also in attendance were Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, who are guests of the royal family after attending the Order of the Garter Service at Windsor Castle yesterday.
The royal carriage procession this afternoon marked the official start of the annual five-day racing festival, which kicks off with the Queen Anne Stakes today and will run until Friday.
It has long been a highlight of the British social calendar, with thousands of well-heeled racegoers turning out in their finest morning suits, summer dresses, and most extravagant hats for the occasion.
Today was no exception, with Lady Kitty Spencer, Kirsty Gallacher, Jodie Kidd and Viscountess Weymouth among the high-profile attendees who dressed to the nines.
